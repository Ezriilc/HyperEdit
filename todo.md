## Things to do:
---

* Save Boost Keycode to config file.

* Check IJKL movement tweaks.

* Save config data per vessel so that the infinite resource tracking can follow vessels!

* Probably need a UI rework for Misc Tools, and Vessel Rendezvous.

* #24 When teleporting to orbit, optionally move position to lit side of body.

* #35 Add horizontal velocity to the Lander's Drop function to enable aircraft/space plane testing.

* #31 Freeze Resource button.

* #30 Add easier ways to set an orbit.

* #11 Set Rotation for non-rockets. (Spaceplanes, Aircraft, Bases, etc.)

* #23 Large numbers of resources don't display well.
      Work on the scrolling idea.

* #38 Do we need to show the shortcut to the KSP Debug Menu?
